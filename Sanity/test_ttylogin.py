"""
This module contains tests that approximates testing of SC login in virtual
console. They are implemented as execution of login command in pexpect.

Login prompt in virtual console appears as a result of systemd running agetty
service that executes getty command to get TTY and executes login command in
that TTY. Therefore, execution of login command in nearly the same way agetty
does it is good approximation to manual testing in virtual console.
